# Materials Project (next-gen)

This folder will contain some tips and tricks for querying the Materials Project using the [`mp-api`](https://github.com/materialsproject/api). 
## Installation

It can be installed through PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/mp-api/).

```
pip install mp-api
```

## Getting setup

You will need to register on the next-gen Materials Project site (https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) and get your API key from the website in order to use the API.

I would first recommend reading through the documentation for the Materials Project (https://docs.materialsproject.org/downloading-data/how-do-i-download-the-materials-project-database) as the explanations and the code examples should be sufficient to get started with making queries with the new API.
